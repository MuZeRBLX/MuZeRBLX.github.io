        <p>This is part of my book, Not How It's Supposed To be. A story of love and loss.</p>
          <div></div>
          <div><p>“My name is Jason, and I lost my best friend around a year ago. I really, and I mean really.. miss Her.” I said as I looked down at the carpeted ground, my voice slowly fading out to barely a whisper. I started again at a medium pace, “And one Interesting fact about me? I would say that I don’t like Mirrors, just kinda weirds me out looking at myself” The Leader’s chair creaked as he leant forward. “That’s a very nice fact, Jason. And I am very sorry for your loss.” The leader had a bright smile as he said this. That made me think, how she had a really nice smile too. Her face used to bring light to every single dark crevice I was in. That smile was so contagious. Anytime that I wasn’t doing well, she was there. Anytime she was there I couldn’t be sad, because I had the greatest girl to ever exist right next to me. And her eyes too. Her bright blue eyes reflected the sunlight every time the sun shined on her. Her eyes were like the ocean, so deep and expanding, so much more under the first layer. I could just drown in those eyes. The first day we met, or rather the first day I saw her, was the 5th of February. It was a few days away from the end of the First Semester and tests were being done today. She was waiting outside of the Chemistry classroom to be let in. She saw me and waved as I was walking by. I smiled and waved back, slowly tilting my head down towards the black and blue tile design. I couldn’t really imagine being friends with her at the time, even though my heart was beating miles out of my chest. I thought she was kinda pretty and I just didn’t really value myself anywhere near her. Out of 10 I’m a 5 and she was like a 50, completely different sides of the scale. As I made it back to my class, I kept thinking of her, she really was kind of pretty. But I doubted that I’d see her again anyway.</p></div>
